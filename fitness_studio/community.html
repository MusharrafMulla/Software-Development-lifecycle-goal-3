                      "“Pre-covid I was attending another gym in the area and found the class sizes overwhelming. I felt like I wasn’t seeing improvement from the classes because I felt out of place and uncomfortable in the gym. Additionally at the end of 2020 into 2021 I had a few health scares that made me wake up and realize a change was needed. I know it sounds cliché but PSTS has been life changing for me. For the first time I truly feel like I belong and do not feel intimidated. I love the smaller session sizes and the focus from the trainers. One of my favorite things is each day when I walk in I am asked how I am feeling. The staff truly wants to know how we are feeling. Another close favorite is encouragement from the staff. All of them are great at this but one of the trainers regularly tells me “you are stronger than you think.” Repeatedly hearing this each time I train, especially in the beginning when I didn’t have belief in myself, pushed me. Knowing someone saw something in me I couldn’t see in myself gave me the drive to push harder and strive for better. I am most excited to set and reach goals I didn’t think possible in the beginning. I am excited to see how much I can lift and what I am truly capable of. Beyond the weight loss I have noticed my balance is getting better which was an initial concern. One thing I certainly did not see when I began PSTS was another bonding experience with my son who also trains with PSTS in the athlete program. We often talk about PSTS at home and have friendly jabbing at each other when one of us, mainly me, hits a new level of weights. He does not like to be outdone by mom.”"

                    “She kept me accountable with kindness. I am a whole new person, my clothes fit, I feel 20 years younger, able to take on challenging outdoor activities with confidence. New Lease on life!“
                    “Theoretically, I placed fitness and health as the highest priority and yet in practice, it fell to the bottom of my list. Year after year as I put fitness off until ‘tomorrow’ or ‘next week’ I began missing out on experiences I dreamt of, knowing I wasn’t fit enough for activities I wanted to chase. I had to take it out of my own hands; and make a real commitment. I desperately wanted to avoid spending my senior years pushing a walker around. Thanks to Chris’ expert guidance and attention to personal detail she set me on a trajectory to success, fully customized for my needs. Thanks so much!.”

                <h3>The Online Fitness Revolution</h3>
                <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, a virtual fitness community called "Fit at Home" launched a 30-day challenge to help people stay active while confined to their homes. The challenge included daily workout videos, live-streamed classes, and a supportive online forum. Participants from around the world shared their progress, tips, and encouragement. The challenge not only helped people stay fit but also provided a sense of connection during a time of isolation. Many participants reported improved mental health and a sense of accomplishment after completing the challenge.</p>

                <h3>The Transformation of Julie</h3>
                <p>Julie, a mother of two, joined a local fitness community that organized a 12-week transformation challenge. Struggling with post-pregnancy weight and low self-esteem, Julie found motivation in the supportive environment of the community. Through guided workouts, nutritional advice, and constant encouragement from fellow participants, Julie lost 25 pounds and significantly improved her strength and endurance. The camaraderie and accountability kept her motivated, and she continued her fitness journey beyond the challenge, eventually becoming a mentor for new participants.</p>
